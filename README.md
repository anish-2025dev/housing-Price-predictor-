## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on a variety of property characteristics. It demonstrates the full ML pipeline from raw data to a saved model and scaler, ideal for those learning about data preprocessing, model training, and deployment readiness.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is **HousePrices.csv**, containing detailed attributes of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

### 🏘️ Key Features:

- `Id`: Unique identifier for each house
- `Dwell_Type`: Type of dwelling
- `Zone_Class`: Zoning classification
- `LotFrontage`: Linear feet of street connected
- `LotArea`: Lot size in square feet
- `Road_Type`, `Alley`, `Property_Shape`, `LandContour`, `Utilities`, `Neighborhood`, and more...
- `Property_Sale_Price`: **Target variable** representing the sale price of the property

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Install all required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn numpy scikit-learn matplotlib joblib
````

## 📓 Notebook Structure

The Jupyter Notebook `housingpricepredictor.ipynb` is structured into the following sections:

### 1. 📥 Importing Libraries

All necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of the notebook.

### 2. 📊 Data Loading & Initial Inspection

* Loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
* Displays shape, sample rows (`df.head()`), data types, null values, and summary statistics

### 3. 🔧 Handling Missing Values

* Visualizes missing values using seaborn heatmaps
* Columns with missing values are identified and filled using appropriate strategies:

  * **Numeric:** Filled with median or zero
  * **Categorical:** Filled with values like `'No Garage'`, `'No Basement'`, or mode

### 4. 🔢 Feature Engineering & Encoding

* Categorical columns are encoded using `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing`
* Ensures all features are numeric and suitable for model input

### 5. 🧠 Model Training & Evaluation

* Defines features `X` and target `y`
* Splits data into training and testing sets
* Trains a `RandomForestRegressor`
* Evaluates performance using **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

### 6. 💾 Model & Scaler Saving

* Saves the trained model as `model_rfr.pkl`
* Saves the scaler (e.g., `StandardScaler`) as `scaler.pkl`
* Uses `joblib.dump()` for serialization

---

## ✅ Key Steps

✔️ **Data Cleaning**
Handled all missing values using logical and statistical strategies for a complete dataset.

✔️ **Feature Transformation**
Categorical features were label-encoded to be compatible with scikit-learn models.

✔️ **Model Selection**
Used `RandomForestRegressor`, a reliable ensemble learning method for regression problems.

✔️ **Model Evaluation**
Evaluated model using MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) to quantify predictive accuracy.

✔️ **Model Persistence**
Both model and scaler are saved locally using joblib for easy deployment or reuse.

## 🧠 Model

### Model Used:

**Random Forest Regressor**
`sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`

* Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees
* Good for capturing non-linear relationships
* Reduces overfitting through bagging

### Evaluation Metric:

**MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**
Used to evaluate prediction error as a percentage of actual values.

## 🚀 Usage

Follow these steps to run and test the project:

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

Make sure `housingpricepredictor.ipynb` and `HousePrices.csv` are in the same directory.

### 2. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn numpy scikit-learn matplotlib joblib
```

### 3. Open the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook housingpricepredictor.ipynb
```

### 4. Run All Cells

This will:

* Load and preprocess the dataset
* Train the Random Forest model
* Save:

  * `model_rfr.pkl` — the trained model
  * `scaler.pkl` — the scaler used to transform numerical inputs

### 5. Predict with Saved Files (optional)

You can load the saved model and scaler in any Python script to make predictions on new data:

```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd

# Load model and scaler
model = joblib.load("model_rfr.pkl")
scaler = joblib.load("scaler.pkl")

# Example new data
new_data = pd.DataFrame({...})  # Fill with feature values

# Preprocess
scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)
predictions = model.predict(scaled)
```
